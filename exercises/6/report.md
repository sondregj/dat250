# Experiment Assignment 6

## Installation

I ensured RabbitMQ was installed using Homebrew.

```bash
brew install rabbitmq
```

Then I started the RabbitMQ server.

```bash
brew services start rabbitmq
```

Apart from an issue that arised due to my local configuration having become outdated, the installation was smooth.

## Experiments

I did the tutorial with the Go programming language, and I opted to put all the code for each experiment in a single file for simplicity.

There were no particular issues with the experiments.

Here are links to the code for each experiment:

- [Experiment 2: Hello World](./helloworld/main.go)
- [Experiment 3: Work Queues](./workqueues/main.go)
- [Experiment 4: Publish/Subscribe](./publishsubscribe/main.go)
